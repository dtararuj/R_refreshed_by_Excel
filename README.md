# R_refreshed_by_Excel
Excel report refreshing R script and loading R script results back to Excel.


We can define any Rscript to prepare our data, which we use then in ExcelSheet, loaded by PowerQuerry.

The main advantage of this solution is ability to run Rscript through ExcelSheet and VBA.
Rscript will do for us any calculation and create .csv file, which we will load back in ExcelSheet.
